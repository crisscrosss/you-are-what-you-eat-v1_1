## You are what you eat

A simple two button game for the BBC micro:bit


You are a dot on the screen. You need to eat the other dot to get a point. When you eat the dot, you become it.

Try and eat as many dots as possible within 40 seconds to get a high score.


B moves your dot to the right and A moves your dot down.
